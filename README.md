# AetherKiri

[English](README.md) | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

AetherKiri is a Godot-hosted KiriKiri2 runtime. The project uses a C++ engine
core loaded by a Godot 4.6 GDExtension, with Godot-owned rendering as the
default product path.

## Architecture

```text
Godot App Shell
  -> GDExtension Host
    -> C++ Engine Core
      -> KiriKiri Runtime / Plugins
```

The default renderer is **Godot Native**. It renders through Godot
`RenderingDevice` resources owned by the Godot app. **GPU Bridge** remains an
explicit compatibility/performance backend for external native GPU render
targets imported by Godot. **Debug CPU** is a visible fallback path only and is
not accepted as a performance target.

## Repository Layout

- `apps/godot_app/` - Godot project, scenes, settings UI, performance/log panel,
  and export presets.
- `bridge/godot_extension/` - Godot native host library entry points.
- `bridge/engine_api/` - C ABI used by the host layer to drive the C++ engine.
- `cpp/core/` - KiriKiri2 runtime, visual system, audio, storage, VM, and plugin
  support.
- `cpp/plugins/` - bundled native plugin implementations and compatibility
  stubs.
- `tests/profiles/` - per-game probe profiles. Committed profiles must not
  contain machine-local game paths.

## Render Backends

| Backend | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Godot Native | Default Godot-owned GPU rendering path. |
| GPU Bridge | Explicit external GPU render-target bridge for comparison and compatibility. |
| Debug CPU | RGBA readback/upload fallback for debugging only. |

The Godot settings UI persists the selected backend and warns when changing it
while a game session is active, because render resources must be recreated.

## Building

Prerequisites:

- CMake 3.28+
- Ninja
- vcpkg, either in `.devtools/vcpkg` or via `VCPKG_ROOT`
- Godot at `/Applications/Godot.app` or `GODOT_BIN=/path/to/Godot`
- Xcode for macOS/iOS exports

Common builds:

```bash
./build.sh macos debug
./build.sh macos release
./build.sh ios debug --simulator
./build.sh ios release
```

The scripts build the native engine and Godot host library, stage them under
`apps/godot_app/bin/`, then run the matching Godot export preset when Godot is
available.

## Testing Build Artifacts

### macOS App

Build and launch the exported app:

```bash
./build.sh macos release
open out/godot/macos/release/AetherKiri.app
```

For debug logging from the terminal:

```bash
./build.sh macos debug
out/godot/macos/debug/AetherKiri.app/Contents/MacOS/AetherKiri
```

Add a game through the app UI, or pass a local test game only for the current
run:

```bash
AETHERKIRI_GAME_PATH="/path/to/game" \
out/godot/macos/debug/AetherKiri.app/Contents/MacOS/AetherKiri
```

### iOS Simulator

Build the simulator export:

```bash
./build.sh ios debug --simulator
```

Open the generated Xcode project or install the built app with `simctl` after
building it from Xcode:

```bash
xcrun simctl boot "iPad Pro 11-inch (M4)"
xcrun simctl install booted /path/to/AetherKiri.app
xcrun simctl launch booted com.example.aetherkiri
```

The bundle identifier depends on the export preset and signing configuration.

### iOS Device

Build the iOS export project:

```bash
./build.sh ios release
```

Then build and install with Xcode or command line tools:

```bash
xcodebuild \
  -project out/godot/ios/release/AetherKiri.xcodeproj \
  -scheme AetherKiri \
  -configuration Release \
  -destination 'generic/platform=iOS' \
  -allowProvisioningUpdates \
  build
```

After Xcode creates `AetherKiri.app`, install it to a paired device:

```bash
xcrun devicectl list devices
xcrun devicectl device install app \
  --device <device-identifier> \
  /path/to/AetherKiri.app
```

On iOS/iPadOS, copy games through the Files app into:

```text
On My iPhone/iPad -> AetherKiri -> Games
```

Return to AetherKiri and tap refresh.

## Validation

Useful migration checks:

```bash
rg "F[l]utter|f[l]utter|A[N]GLE|Platform[ ]Graphics" README.md README.zh-CN.md apps bridge build CMakeLists.txt
rg "u[n]official-angle|l[i]bEGL|l[i]bGLESv2" CMakeLists.txt bridge cpp build vcpkg.json
./build.sh macos debug
./build.sh ios debug --simulator
build/validate_godot_native.sh
build/validate_gpu_bridge.sh
```

Godot script checks:

```bash
/Applications/Godot.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot \
  --headless \
  --path apps/godot_app \
  --check-only \
  --quit
```

## Per-Game Probe Profiles

Probe scripts can be driven by `AETHERKIRI_TEST_CONFIG`. Keep committed profiles
generic; do not commit local absolute game paths. Use `AETHERKIRI_SMOKE_GAME` or
an untracked local profile for machine-specific paths.

Example smoke test:

```bash
AETHERKIRI_TEST_CONFIG="$PWD/tests/profiles/kr37s.json" \
AETHERKIRI_SMOKE_GAME="/path/to/game" \
/Applications/Godot.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot \
  --path apps/godot_app \
  --script res://scripts/smoke_test.gd
```

Example render/interaction probe:

```bash
AETHERKIRI_TEST_CONFIG="$PWD/tests/profiles/kr37s.json" \
AETHERKIRI_SMOKE_GAME="/path/to/game" \
/Applications/Godot.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot \
  --path apps/godot_app \
  --script res://scripts/step_render_probe.gd
```

Profile fields:

- `game_path`: optional game directory or XP3 path. Keep blank in committed
  profiles unless the path is portable.
- `backend`: render backend, usually `Godot Native`.
- `surface_size`: engine render surface, for example `[1280, 720]`.
- `window_size`: probe window size.
- `coord_size`: coordinate space used by recorded click points.
- `startup_timeout_frames`, `warmup_frames`, `after_click_frames`,
  `measure_frames`: timing knobs.
- `clicks`: ordered interaction steps with `name`, `x`, `y`, and optional
  `after_frames`.
- `perf_input`: compatibility settings for `perf_input_probe.gd`.

Acceptance requires startup, rendering, input, menu operations, audio, save
paths, clean exit, and performance parity from Godot Native or GPU Bridge. Debug
CPU is only a diagnostic fallback.
